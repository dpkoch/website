    <p>Below are a few pictures to give you an idea of the types of things I like to get up to. It's an odd collection of hobbies, but I have fun with it! Before we get to the photos, here are a few of my interests that aren't pictured:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Music:</strong> I play classical piano, and play around with a few other instruments as well. It's been a while since I've had the time to practice seriously, but my current goal is to learn <a href="http://www.company7.com/bosendorfer/audio/ProkofievSonNo1FmOp1_Lura_Sep2006.mp3">this piece</a> (Prokofiev's <i>Piano Sonata No. 1</i> in F minor).</li>
        <li><strong>Reading:</strong> My go-to genre is Fantasy/Sci-Fi. <i>Lord of the Rings</i> will probably always hold the top spot for me (yes, I've read <i>The Silmarillion</i>, as well as a few most people have never heard of). I'm also currently having a lot of fun with Brandon Sanderson's books, especially those that are part of the <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/what-is-the-cosmere/">Cosmere</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Tinkering:</strong> I'm not happy unless I have a project (usually too many of them). Often those projects take the form of software or PCB/electronics design, but I also like getting my hands dirty with cars or elsewhere. Once I have the space I'd love to start doing some more woodworking.</li>
        <li><strong>Web development:</strong> I don't get into to it too often, but this website is Exhibit A!</li>
    </ul>
