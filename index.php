<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>I'm an engineering PhD working on autonomous systems. I am thrilled to be getting involved in what is potentially the most transformative technology that will emerge during my lifetime. I've been lucky to have had opportunities to be involved with a number of projects in both academia and industry, and I look forward to continuing to engage with the challenges that will make autonomous technologies a reality in a safe and responsible manner. I love what I do, and I'm excited to keep doing it!</p>

<p>I hope that this website will help you get to know a little bit about me, both profesionally and personally. Thanks for visiting!</p>
